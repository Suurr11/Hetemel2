Baby, I'm preyin' on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Baby, I'm- (hey)
So, what you tryin' to do to me? (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah (hey)
You're like a drug that's killin' me (hey)
I cut you out entirely (hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you
Yeah, you can start over (hey), you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea (hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you makin' that sound (hey)
Takin' me down, rollin' on the ground (hey)
You can pretend that it was me (hey), but no, oh
Baby, I'm preyin' on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Baby, I'm- (hey)
So, if I run, it's not enough (hey)
You're still in my head, forever stuck (hey)
So you can do what you wanna do, yeah (hey)
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up (hey)
But don't deny the animal (hey)
That comes alive when I'm inside you
Yeah, you can start over (hey), you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea (hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you makin' that sound (hey)
Takin' me down, rollin' on the ground (hey)
You can pretend that it was me (hey), but no, oh
Baby, I'm preyin' on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals (oh)
Maybe you think that you can hide (yeah)
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals
Like animals-mals
Baby, I'm-
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
That beast inside-side-side-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, girl, don't lie, lie, lie, lie (no, girl, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (you can't deny)
That beast inside-side-side-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo (hey)
Whoa (hey)
Whoa
Just like animals (hey), animals
Like animals-mals (hey)
Just like animals (hey, yeah), animals (yeah)
Like animals-mals (yeah)
Ah-ooh!
Baby, I'm preyin' on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals (yeah), animals (oh)
Like animals-mals (oh)
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles (from miles)
Just like animals (yeah), animals (yeah)
Like animals-mals (ooh)
Baby, I'm-
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (yeah)
That beast inside-side-side-side
Yeah (hey), yeah (hey), yeah
No, girl, don't lie, lie, lie, lie (no, girl, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (you can't deny)
